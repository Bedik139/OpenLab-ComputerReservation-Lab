================================================================================
3. HOW AUTHENTICATION WORKS
================================================================================

- All user accounts are stored in localStorage under key 'openlab_accounts'
- On first load, SAMPLE_USERS (6 users) are seeded into this store
- Login validates email + password against stored accounts
- On success, a session object (without password) is saved to 'openlab_user'
- Registration creates a new entry in the accounts store with the password
- Duplicate emails and student IDs are rejected during registration
- After registration, the user is auto-logged in and redirected to dashboard
- Logging out removes the session and redirects to the landing page
- Password changes update the account in the accounts store directly


================================================================================
4. ROLE-BASED ACCESS
================================================================================

  - Register and login
  - View lab availability and seat maps
  - Reserve a seat (30-min slots)
  - View, edit, and cancel their own reservations
