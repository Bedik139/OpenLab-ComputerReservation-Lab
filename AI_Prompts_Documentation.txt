================================================================================
1. PROJECT SETUP & BOOTSTRAP FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

Prompt:

  I'm building a computer lab reservation system for a university called OpenLab.
  Suggest a Bootstrap 4.4.1 boilerplate setup using CDN links for Bootstrap CSS,
  jQuery 3.4.1 slim, Popper.js 1.16.0, and Bootstrap JS. The project should use
  Google Fonts with Roboto at weights 400, 500, and 700. Include a separate
  style.css file for custom styles. The overall theme should feel dark and modern
  — think dark semi-transparent backgrounds over a fixed background image, with a
  green accent color #04AA6D as the brand identity.


================================================================================
2. NAVIGATION BAR (TOPNAV)
================================================================================

Prompt:

  Suggest a fixed top navigation bar for a university lab reservation system. The
  navbar should have a height of around 80px with a semi-transparent dark
  background using rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) and sit at z-index: 1000. It should include
  the following navigation items in this order:

  - Brand logo on the left displaying "OpenLab" that links back to the homepage
  - Home — links to index.html
  - Available Slots — links to cmpslots.html
  - Dashboard — links to dashboard.html
  - My Reservations — links to reservations.html
  - A pill-shaped search bar on the right side with a translucent white background
    that expands from 150px to 200px on focus and glows green (#04AA6D) when active
  - A profile dropdown or login link on the far right that changes depending on
    whether the user is logged in or not

  The active page link should be highlighted using the brand green color. All text
  should be white with smooth 0.5s transitions on hover states. Keep the layout
  centered with a max-width of 1200px.


================================================================================
3. LANDING PAGE & HERO SECTION
================================================================================

Prompt:

  Suggest a landing page layout for a lab reservation web app. The hero section
  should take full viewport height (min-height: 100vh) with a fixed background
  image for a subtle parallax effect. Overlay the background with a dark gradient
  so white text remains readable. Center the content vertically and horizontally
  using flexbox. The hero content should include:

  - A bold headline like "Find Your Seat, Skip the Search"
  - A subtitle explaining real-time lab availability across the university
  - Two CTA buttons side by side:
    - A primary button with a green gradient (#04AA6D to #038a58) labeled
      "View Labs"
    - An outline/ghost button with a transparent background and white border
      labeled "Register Now"

  Below the hero, include a 3-column feature grid with glassmorphism cards
  highlighting:
    1. Real-Time Availability
    2. Easy Reservations (30-minute slots, up to 7 days ahead)
    3. Multiple Buildings (Gokongwei, Andrew, Velasco)

  The feature section background should use a dark navy gradient (rgba(20, 20, 35)
  to rgba(25, 25, 45)).


================================================================================
4. GLASSMORPHISM CARD DESIGN
================================================================================

Prompt:

  Suggest a reusable glassmorphism card style for a dark-themed web application.
  The card should have the following properties:

  - Background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) for a frosted translucent look
  - Border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) to define the edges subtly
  - Border-radius: 12px-16px for rounded corners
  - Multi-layered box-shadow for depth:
    - Outer shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)
    - Inner glow: inset 0 0 80px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)
    - Brand accent glow: 0 0 20px rgba(4, 170, 109, 0.1)
  - On hover, darken the background slightly and intensify the shadow to create
    a lift effect
  - Add a green-tinted overlay on hover for visual feedback
  - Use white text (#ffffff) as primary and rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75) as
    secondary text
  - Smooth 0.5s transitions on all interactive states

  This card style will be reused across feature cards, lab cards, dashboard cards,
  reservation cards, and profile cards with minor layout variations per context.


================================================================================
5. AUTHENTICATION PAGES (LOGIN & REGISTER)
================================================================================

5.1 Login Page
--------------

Prompt:

  Suggest a login page layout for the reservation system. Center a single
  glassmorphism card vertically and horizontally on the page. The card should
  contain:

    reservations"
  - Form fields for Email Address and Password with translucent inputs
    (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) background, white text, green glow on focus)
  - A "Remember me" checkbox (extends session to 3 weeks) and a "Forgot
    password?" link on the same row
  - A full-width "Sign In" button using the green gradient style
  - A bottom text: "Don't have an account? Sign up" linking to the register page

  All form inputs should have rounded corners (8px), white placeholder text at
  50% opacity, and a green border + box-shadow glow on focus.


5.2 Register Page
-----------------

Prompt:

  Suggest a registration page following the same centered card layout as the login
  page. The card should include:

    3. Hours This Month
    4. Day Streak

  Main Content Grid (2x2 card layout):
    1. Upcoming Reservations Card — List the next 2 reservations with a
       calendar-style date block (day/month), lab name, seat number, building
       location, time range, and an "Upcoming" status badge. Include a "View All"
       link.
    2. Quick Actions Card — 5 clickable action items: Reserve a Seat, Manage
       Bookings, Edit Profile, Find Users, Walk-In (Tech).
    3. Recent Activity Card — Activity feed showing completed sessions, new
       bookings, and cancellations with color-coded dot indicators and timestamps.
    4. Frequently Used Labs Card — List top 3 labs ranked by visit count.

  All cards should use the glassmorphism style. The content area should start with
  padding-top: 100px to account for the fixed navbar.

================================================================================
9. RESPONSIVE DESIGN & POLISH
================================================================================

Prompt:

  Suggest responsive design adjustments and final polish for the entire
  application:

  - The fixed navbar should remain accessible on all screen sizes with a max-width
    container of 1200px
  - The landing hero should stay full viewport height on all devices with proper
    text scaling
  - Card grids (features, labs, stats, users) should collapse from multi-column to
    single-column on smaller screens
  - All form inputs should maintain their translucent styling and green focus glow
    across pages
  - Buttons should follow two consistent styles:
    - Primary: Green gradient with white text, green glow shadow, slight lift on
      hover
    - Outline/Ghost: Transparent background, white border, brighter background on
      hover with a 3px lift
